## Missing / to-source (4 items)

To complete the homepage and persona pages cleanly, these four assets need to be sourced:

1. `vertical-coldstorage.jpg` — cold storage / grocery interior with high-bay LED lighting
2. `vertical-datacenter.jpg` — server room or data center interior
3. `vertical-hospitality.jpg` — hotel lobby / restaurant interior
4. `mega-tubularch.jpg` — tubulⒶRCH linear product close-up or installed scene

**Resolution paths:**
- Use Manus image gen (NanoBanana style — it's what generated the existing photography; consistent style)
- Use DALL-E or similar
- Use licensed stock photography
- Substitute existing photos temporarily (e.g., commercial-office.jpg as placeholder for hospitality)

For Iteration 1 (homepage), the homepage hero + Featured Families do NOT depend on the missing 4. The 8-vertical "Installed at" section CAN proceed with placeholder grey tiles for the 3 missing verticals + a "photography pending" badge — Manus implements this gracefully.
